# Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Definition and Guide

## OSPO Definition

**An open source program office (OSPO) is designed to be the center of competency for an organizations open source operations and structure. This can include setting code use, distribution, selection, auditing and other policies, as well as training developers, ensuring legal compliance and promoting and building community engagement that benefits the organization strategically.**

The responsibilities of a program office are varied. These include:

* Clearly communicating the open source strategy within and outside the company
* Owning and overseeing the execution of the strategy (see our guide to creating an open source strategy for business)
* Facilitating the effective use of open source in commercial products and services
* Ensuring high-quality and frequent releases of code to open source communities
* Engaging with developer communities and seeing that the company contributes back to other projects effectively
* Fostering an open source culture within an organization
* Maintaining open source license compliance reviews and oversight

*For every company, the role of the open source program office will likely be custom-configured based on its business, products, and goals. There is no broad template for building an open source program that applies across all industries â€” or even across all companies in a single industry.*
